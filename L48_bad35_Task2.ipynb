It is a really powerful and useful technique clearly exemplifying the value of having a parametrisation of our *ignorance* about a specific problem so that we can address this. We will use a Gaussian process as a surrogate model but when you go through the notebook you will see that there is nothing in the methodology itself that is tied to this specific surrogage. Given that you have already implemented a Gaussian process model in the previous worksheet, feel free to use that code instead as I am sure it is much better than your Professors attempt at coding :-).\n",

    "Matern co-variance is useful compared to the squared-exponential function / RBF kernel because it enables greater flexibility in identifying/computing our co-variance. That is, because Matern co-variance is parameterized by the $\\nu$ (which relates to the \"smoothness\" of the function), we are able to (A) consider a range of possible co-variance functions (including the squared-exponential as $\\nu\\rightarrow\\infty$), (B) consider a range of flexibilities of kernel functions, and (C) improve our computational efficiency and ability to test samples by limiting the necessity to work over a fully differentiable function. This can be helpful towards capturing sharp changes in the true function being evaluated, including discontinuities.\n"

No, in the case where we expect the minima to be anywhere we cannot get any reduced entropy about it by observing the function.
